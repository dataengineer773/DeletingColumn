We want to delete a column from your DataFrame, The best way to delete a column is to use drop with the parameter axis=1 (i.e., the column axis), You can also use a list of column names as the main argument to drop multiple columns at once
If a column does not have a name (which can sometimes happen), you can drop it by its column index using dataframe.columns, drop is the idiomatic method of deleting a column. An alternative method is del dataframe['Age'],
which works most of the time but is not recommended because of how it is called within pandas, I recommend that you avoid using pandasâ€™ inplace=True argument. Many pandas methods include an inplace parameter, which when 
True edits the DataFrame directly. This can lead to problems in more complex data processing pipelines because we are treating the DataFrames as mutable objects (which  they technically are). I recommend treating DataFrames
as immutable objects. For example In this example, we are not mutating the DataFrame dataframe but instead are making a new DataFrame that is an altered version of dataframe called dataframe_name_dropped. If you treat your
DataFrames as immutable objects, you will save yourself a lot of headaches down the road.
